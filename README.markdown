Try Handlebars.js

Try Handlebars is a web tool I made to help preview [Handlebars.js](http://www.handlebarsjs.com/) templates easily in the browser. 

This site was built quickly on top of [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/).

__How does it work?__

All of the example templates and contexts are stored in the index.html file as different script blocks. When you select a template it populates the textareas.
They are eval'd when you click compile and HTML output is displayed in the output textarea. An html preview is also displayed inline but I will probably remove that.

Please feel free to fork the site to fix anything I may have screwed up! Send me a pull request and I will put it up asap.
